        Scope of Work

        they may learn quickly, and so that to improve the productivity of our society.
        Approach & Methodology
        Update Short-term technical education and training center Approach and Methodology is highly
        participatory and student centered. We communicate clearly with our students and the
        company they are in for a better outcome. Therefore, together we generate practical strategies
        for the resolution of these problems.
        Some of teaching and learning methods we use:-
        • Blackboard or Whiteboard:This may be the most “old-fashioned” method, but it can still be effective, especially if you
        invite trainees to write on the board or ask for feedback that you write on the board.
        • Overhead Projector:
        This method is increasingly being replaced with PowerPoint presentations, which are less
        manually demanding, but overheads do allow you to write on them and customize
        presentations easily on the spot.
        • Power-point Presentation:
        Presentation software is used to create customized group training sessions that are led by an
        instructor. Training materials are provided on computer and displayed on a screen for any
        number of trainees. Students can also use the programs individually, which allows for easy
        make-up sessions for employees who miss the group session. This method is one of the most
        popular lecture methods and can be combined with handouts and other interactive methods.
        • Video PORTION:
        Lectures can be broken up with video portions that explain sections of the training topic or that
        present case studies for discussion.
        • Storytelling:
        Stories can be used as examples of right and wrong ways to perform skills with the outcome of
        each way described.
        • Interactive Methods:
        Institute of Project Management Professionals shall break up training sessions and keep
        trainees attentive and involved, including:
         Quizzes:
        For long, complicated training, training facilitators will stop periodically to administer brief
        quizzes on information presented to that point. The training can also begin sessions with a prequiz and let participants know there will also be a follow-up quiz. Trainees will stay engaged in
        order to improve their pre-quiz scores on the final quiz. Further motivate participants by
        offering awards to the highest scorers or the most improved scores.
         Small Group Discussions:
        Small groups of delegates will be created and give case studies or work situations to discuss or
        solve. This is a good way for knowledgeable veteran employees to pass on their experience to
        newer employ</pre>
